# Epublib #
Epublib is a java library for managing epub files.

Itâ€™s capable of reading and writing epub files programmatically and from the command-line tool.

It's currently quite useful for generating epubs from sets of html files and for manipulating things like author, title and coverpage in existing epubs.
